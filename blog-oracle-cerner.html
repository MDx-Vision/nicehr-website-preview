        </div>

        <p>Oracle completed its acquisition of Cerner in June 2022. Four years later, the integration continues. Healthcare organizations running Cerner systems face decisions about upgrades, migrations, and long-term EHR strategy. Here is what we observe in the market.</p>

        <h2>The Current State.</h2>

        <p>Oracle Health (formerly Cerner) remains a major EHR platform. Thousands of healthcare organizations continue to run Millennium and other Cerner products. The installed base is not disappearing. However, the product roadmap has shifted.</p>

        <p>Oracle is investing heavily in cloud infrastructure. The Oracle Health platform integrates with Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI). New features prioritize cloud-native capabilities. Organizations running on-premise Cerner systems face increasing pressure to migrate.</p>

        <div class="key-point">
          <h4>The Trend.</h4>
          <p>Oracle is consolidating product lines and pushing cloud adoption. Organizations should expect continued pressure to move from on-premise to Oracle Cloud. Planning should account for this trajectory.</p>
        </div>

        <p>Support for legacy versions continues but with decreasing investment. Organizations on older Millennium versions report longer wait times for support tickets. New development focuses on cloud-first features. The gap between cloud and on-premise capabilities is widening.</p>

        <h2>Migration Considerations.</h2>

        <p>Organizations evaluating EHR transitions have three primary options:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Stay with Oracle Health:</strong> Migrate to Oracle Cloud Infrastructure. Accept Oracle's product roadmap. Benefit from continued vendor support and integration with Oracle's broader technology stack.</li>
          <li><strong>Migrate to Epic:</strong> Join the growing number of organizations moving from Cerner to Epic. Accept significant implementation costs and timeline. Gain access to Epic's development investment and community.</li>
          <li><strong>Maintain current state:</strong> Continue operating existing Cerner systems. Accept diminishing support and feature investment. Preserve current workflows and avoid migration costs. Defer the decision to a later date.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Each option has trade-offs. There is no universally correct choice. Organizational size, financial position, clinical priorities, and technical capabilities all factor into the decision.</p>

        <h2>Market Movement.</h2>

        <p>Large health systems are the most visible in their decisions. Several high-profile Cerner-to-Epic migrations have been announced or completed. These receive significant industry attention.</p>

        <p>Smaller organizations face different dynamics. Epic's implementation costs remain substantial. Community hospitals and physician groups often cannot justify the investment. For these organizations, Oracle Health or alternative platforms remain viable options.</p>

        <div class="key-point">
          <h4>The Reality.</h4>
          <p>Headlines focus on large system migrations. Most Cerner customers are not large academic medical centers. Their migration calculus differs significantly. Size-appropriate analysis is essential.</p>
        </div>

        <p>The competitive landscape has consolidated. Epic and Oracle Health (Cerner) dominate the acute care market. MEDITECH maintains a strong presence in community hospitals. Other vendors serve specific niches. Organizations evaluating alternatives have fewer options than a decade ago.</p>

        <h2>Oracle's Investment Areas.</h2>

        <p>Understanding Oracle's priorities helps predict platform direction. Current investment areas include:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Cloud migration tools:</strong> Streamlined paths from on-premise Millennium to Oracle Cloud</li>
          <li><strong>AI and machine learning:</strong> Clinical decision support, operational optimization, predictive analytics</li>
          <li><strong>Interoperability:</strong> FHIR-based data exchange, patient access APIs</li>
          <li><strong>Revenue cycle:</strong> Integrated billing, claims management, and financial analytics</li>
          <li><strong>Population health:</strong> Care management, risk stratification, value-based care support</li>
        </ul>

        <p>These investments align with Oracle's enterprise software strengths. Organizations whose priorities match these areas may benefit from Oracle's roadmap. Those with needs outside these areas should evaluate carefully.</p>

        <h2>Staffing Implications.</h2>

        <p>The Oracle transition has affected the consultant labor market. Experienced Cerner consultants remain in demand. Organizations need expertise for upgrades, cloud migrations, and optimization. The supply of consultants has not increased proportionally.</p>

        <p>Some Cerner consultants have transitioned to Epic. The migration wave created demand for consultants with both platforms' experience. These dual-certified consultants command premium rates. They are particularly valuable for organizations considering platform changes.</p>

        <div class="key-point">
          <h4>The Staffing Market.</h4>
          <p>Oracle Health consulting talent remains constrained. Organizations planning significant Oracle Health initiatives should secure resources early. Experienced Cerner consultants have multiple options in the current market.</p>
        </div>

        <p>TNG maintains consultants across both platforms. Our network includes Oracle Health specialists for optimization and upgrade projects, as well as consultants experienced in Cerner-to-Epic conversions. Contact us to discuss your specific staffing needs.</p>

        <h2>Decision Framework.</h2>

        <p>Organizations evaluating their Oracle Health strategy should consider:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Contract timeline:</strong> When does your current agreement end? What are the terms for renewal?</li>
          <li><strong>Technical debt:</strong> How current is your Millennium version? What is required to reach current state?</li>
          <li><strong>Integration dependencies:</strong> How deeply is Cerner integrated with other systems? What would migration require?</li>
          <li><strong>Financial capacity:</strong> Can your organization absorb a major EHR transition? What is the opportunity cost?</li>
          <li><strong>Clinical priorities:</strong> Are there capabilities you need that Oracle Health cannot provide? What are they?</li>
          <li><strong>Workforce stability:</strong> Does your IT team have capacity for a major project? What is the risk of key departures?</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Answers to these questions inform the decision. Organizations with current systems, stable teams, and priorities aligned with Oracle's roadmap may choose to stay. Those with technical debt, integration challenges, or misaligned priorities may pursue alternatives.</p>
