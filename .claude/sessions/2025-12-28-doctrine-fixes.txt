⏺ Here's a summary of the documentation:

  ---
  README.md

  Establishes that the project follows the Enterprise Apple for Healthcare Consulting doctrine. All content must conform to this standard. If conflicts arise, ENTERPRISE_APPLE_DOCTRINE.md takes priority.

  ---
  ENTERPRISE_APPLE_DOCTRINE.md

  The core language doctrine defining how NICEHR communicates:

  What "Enterprise Apple" means:
  - How Apple communicates with healthcare systems, governments, and regulated enterprises
  - Aligns with Deloitte/Atos communication standards

  Core Principles:
  1. Precision over persuasion - State, don't convince
  2. Verbs over adjectives - Built, Delivered, Designed (not "innovative" or "strategic")
  3. One idea per sentence - Short, declarative
  4. Outcome framing - Results first, capabilities second
  5. Calm authority - Composed, inevitable, senior (never clever or enthusiastic)

  Formatting:
  - Headlines: 4–6 words, periods encouraged, no slogans
  - Section intros: One sentence only
  - Body: One sentence per thought, concrete language

  ---
  AI_INSTRUCTIONS.md

  Specific rules for AI-generated content:

  Prohibited words: Strategic, Best-in-class, Cutting-edge, Revolutionary, World-class, Leading, Innovative, Transformative, Next-gen, Disruptive

  Approved CTAs: Explore Solutions, Talk to an Expert, Schedule a Consultation, Request Proposal, View Case Studies, etc.

  Avoid: "Let's talk", "Get started", "Learn more", "Discover", persuasive questions ("Ready to…?"), emotional framing

  Client logos section: Header must be "Healthcare organizations served."

  Claims: Numbers must be sourced; avoid unsupported % claims

  ---
  Final test for all content: Would this be appropriate in an RFP? Would a hospital CIO trust it?

  Guideline Compliance Audit Report

  HIGH PRIORITY - Direct Violations

  1. Taglines/Slogans (Prohibited)

  The doctrine explicitly states: "No slogans or taglines"

  | File                | Line | Violation                                    |
  |---------------------|------|----------------------------------------------|
  | index.html          | 9    | Title: "Healthcare IT. Simplified."          |
  | index.html          | 91   | Hero: "Healthcare IT Consulting. Delivered." |
  | physicians-rcm.html | 89   | "Practice Growth. Simplified."               |

  2. Prohibited CTA "Learn more"

  | File         | Line | Violation                                      |
  |--------------|------|------------------------------------------------|
  | contact.html | 164  | "Learn more about our services and solutions." |

  3. Prohibited Phrase "We offer"

  | File     | Line | Violation                                 |
  |----------|------|-------------------------------------------|
  | faq.html | 144  | "We offer flexible engagement options..." |

  ---
  MEDIUM PRIORITY - Tone Violations

  4. Promotional Language/Superlatives

  | File               | Line | Issue                                           |
  |--------------------|------|-------------------------------------------------|
  | ehr-systems.html   | 100  | "The most widely adopted EHR" - superlative     |
  | ehr-systems.html   | 165  | "modern practices" - promotional                |
  | rcm-platform.html  | 106  | "seamless integration" - promotional            |
  | hospitals-rcm.html | 148  | "Seamless EHR Extension" - promotional headline |

  5. "Comprehensive" (superlative-adjacent)

  | File            | Line | Context                         |
  |-----------------|------|---------------------------------|
  | rcm.html        | 121  | "Comprehensive Solutions"       |
  | faq.html        | 191  | "comprehensive EHR training"    |
  | veterans.html   | 120  | "Comprehensive online training" |
  | government.html | 278  | "Comprehensive IT support"      |

  ---
  LOW PRIORITY - Minor Issues

  6. "Strategic" in Navigation

  The word "strategic" (prohibited) appears as "IT Strategic Planning" in navigation across all 23 HTML pages. This is a service name, so it may be acceptable—but consider renaming to "IT Planning" for full compliance.

  ---
  COMPLIANT ITEMS (Good Adherence)

  - Client logos header: Correctly uses "Healthcare organizations served."
  - CTAs: Most are compliant (Explore Solutions, Talk to an Expert, Contact, Request Proposal, View Platform, View RCM, etc.)
  - Stats scoping: Numbers properly qualified with "(as of 2025)"
  - Delivery network language: Correctly uses "Delivered through NICEHR's delivery network"
  - Testimonials: Direct quotes from clients are acceptable even with promotional language

  ---
  Summary

  | Priority | Count               |
  |----------|---------------------|
  | High     | 5 violations        |
  | Medium   | 8 violations        |
  | Low      | 1 (across 23 files) |

  Overall: The site follows most guidelines well. Main issues are taglines in titles/headers and scattered promotional adjectives. Would you like me to fix these violations?

> is there a way we can create some memory here so when we come back to a 
session we start from where we left off 

⏺ claude-code-guide(Find Claude Code memory features)
  ⎿  Done (4 tool uses · 25.3k tokens · 32s)                               

⏺ Yes, there are several ways to persist context across sessions:

  1. Project Memory (CLAUDE.md)

  Create a CLAUDE.md file in your project root that automatically loads each session:

⏺ Write(CLAUDE.md)
  ⎿  Wrote 39 lines to CLAUDE.md                                           
     # The NICEHR Group Website
     ## Writing Doctrine
     This project follows the **Enterprise Apple for Healthcare 
     Consulting** doctrine.
     See `ENTERPRISE_APPLE_DOCTRINE.md` and `AI_INSTRUCTIONS.md` for full
     guidelines.
     **Key rules:**
     - No slogans or taglines
     - No promotional language (strategic, innovative, comprehensive,
     seamless, etc.)
     - Short, declarative sentences
     … +29 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

⏺ Created CLAUDE.md - this file automatically loads every time you start Claude Code in this directory.

  2. Resume Sessions

  You can also resume previous conversations directly:

  # Continue your most recent session
  claude --continue

  # Pick from a list of past sessions
  claude --resume

  3. Name Sessions for Easy Resumption

  During a session, name it for later:
  /rename nicehr-doctrine-fixes

  Then resume by name:
  claude --resume nicehr-doctrine-fixes

  4. View Current Memory

  Check what's loaded:
  /memory

  ---
  What I set up for you:

  The CLAUDE.md now contains:
  - Writing doctrine summary
  - Approved/prohibited language
  - Site structure
  - Key pages reference
  - Recent work history

  Next time you run claude in this folder, it will automatically know the project context and doctrine rules.

  ⎿  Done (6 tool uses · 24.4k tokens · 16s)                               

⏺ Yes, you can export conversations:

  Export Current Conversation

  /export                     # Copy to clipboard
  /export session-notes.md    # Save to file

  Other Session Commands

  Would you like me to create a docs/ or .claude/sessions/ folder to store exported conversations? You could run /export .claude/sessions/2025-12-28-doctrine-fixes.md to save this session there.

⏺ To reference exported sessions, use the @ import syntax in your CLAUDE.md:

⏺ Done. The @ syntax in CLAUDE.md will import that file's content when Claude Code loads.

  How it works:
  - @path/to/file in CLAUDE.md imports that file as context
  - Works with relative paths, absolute paths, or ~ for home directory
  - Imports can be nested up to 5 levels deep

  Now when you start a new session, Claude Code will load:
  1. CLAUDE.md (project memory)
  2. The referenced session transcript

  Committed and pushed.

> how can i import conversations or projects i have had woith clade ai in 
here 

⏺ Currently there's no direct integration between Claude.ai (web) and Claude Code. Here are your options:

  Option 1: Manual Copy/Paste

  From claude.ai:
  1. Open the conversation
  2. Select and copy the content
  3. Paste into a markdown file

⏺ Write(.claude/sessions/imported/README.md)
  ⎿  Wrote 27 lines to .claude/sessions/imported/README.md                 
     # Imported Conversations
     This folder is for conversations imported from Claude.ai or other
     sources.
     ## How to Import
     1. Go to claude.ai and open the conversation
     2. Copy the relevant content
     3. Create a new .md file here with a descriptive name
     4. Paste and format as markdown

    … +2 lines (ctrl+o to expand)


⏺ Created .claude/sessions/imported/ folder for claude.ai conversations.

  Your folder structure now:

  .claude/
  ├── sessions/
  │   ├── 2025-12-28-doctrine-fixes.txt   # Claude Code exports
  │   └── imported/                        # Claude.ai conversations
  │       └── README.md
  └── README.md

  To import from claude.ai:

  1. Copy conversation from claude.ai
  2. Create file: .claude/sessions/imported/YYYY-MM-DD-topic.md
  3. Paste content
  4. Reference in CLAUDE.md: See @.claude/sessions/imported/filename.md

  Tip

  If you have key decisions or context from claude.ai conversations, you could also just summarize the important parts directly in CLAUDE.md rather than importing full transcripts - keeps things cleaner and faster to load.

> why would we rename this session? 

⏺ Renaming sessions makes them easier to find and resume later.

  Without naming:
  claude --resume
  Shows generic entries like:
  • 2 hours ago - nicehr-website-static
  • Yesterday - nicehr-website-static
  • 3 days ago - nicehr-website-static

  With naming:
  /rename doctrine-compliance-fixes

  Then later:
  claude --resume doctrine-compliance-fixes

  Or in the picker you'd see:
  • doctrine-compliance-fixes - 2 hours ago
  • homepage-redesign - Yesterday
  • rcm-page-updates - 3 days ago

  ---
  For this session - since you already exported it to .claude/sessions/2025-12-28-doctrine-fixes.txt and referenced it in CLAUDE.md, renaming isn't necessary. The full transcript is preserved in your repo.

  Renaming is most useful when you plan to use /resume frequently rather than relying on exports.

> rename this session 

⏺ I can't run slash commands for you - you'll need to type it directly:

  /rename doctrine-compliance-fixes

  Or pick a name that makes sense to you like:
  - nicehr-doctrine-audit
  - enterprise-apple-fixes
  - 2025-12-28-guideline-cleanup

> we can use dates that works 

⏺ Run:

  /rename 2025-12-28-doctrine-fixes

> how can i see this local 

⏺ A few options for viewing locally:

  Quick - just open the file:
  open index.html

  Better - run a local server:

⏺ Bash(python3 -m http.server 8000 &)
  ⎿  Running in the background (↓ to manage)

⏺ Bash(sleep 1 && lsof -i :8000 | head -3)
  ⎿ COMMAND   PID            USER   FD   TYPE             DEVICE SIZE/OFF N

    Python  35463 rafaelrodriguez    4u  IPv6 0xeb8e7cfdde2089c5      0t0
    TCP *:irdmi (LISTEN)


⏺ Server running. Open in browser:

  http://localhost:8000

  To stop it later:
  kill 35463

  Or just close the terminal.

> open http://localhost:8000 

⏺ Bash(open http://localhost:8000)
  ⎿  (No content)

⏺ Should be open in your browser now.
