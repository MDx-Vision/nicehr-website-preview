## Sitewide Phrasing Rules (Deloitte-style)

**Precedence:** If any phrasing rule conflicts with ENTERPRISE_APPLE_DOCTRINE.md, the doctrine wins.


These rules apply to all pages and override ad hoc wording choices.

### 1) Client logos

When client logos are displayed:

- Section header must be: **Healthcare organizations served.**
- If there is a one-line intro sentence, use: **Delivery experience across healthcare systems.**
- Do not imply current engagement unless explicitly true.
- Do not use “leading” or other superlatives.
- Do not use “trusted by” language unless required.

### 2) White-label delivery

Do not name external partners or vendors on the public site.
If disclosure is needed, use only:

- **Delivered through NICEHR’s delivery network.**

### 3) Button microcopy standards

Primary CTAs (approved):

- Explore Solutions
- View All Solutions
- Talk to an Expert
- Schedule a Consultation
- Contact
- Request Proposal
- Request Assessment
- Schedule Demo
- View Platforms
- View Platform
- View DiSChedule
- View RCM
- Request Staffing

Utility CTAs (allowed for navigation, not sales):

- View Case Studies
- View Insights
- View Government Contracting
- Subscribe
- Suggest a Topic
- Meet the Team
- About NICEHR

If a CTA is not in these lists, change it to the closest approved option.

### 4) Claims and numbers

Numbers must be attributable and scoped.

- If a metric is not sourced on-page, remove it or convert it to neutral language.
- Avoid % claims without a source.
- Avoid “24/7” claims unless explicitly supported and framed neutrally.

Approved neutral replacements:

- “Rapid deployment available.”
- “Automation supported within workflows.”
- “Consultants with verified platform experience.”
- “Vetted through verified project work.”

### 5) Prohibited tone patterns

Avoid:

- slogans and taglines
- “leading,” “world-class,” “best-in-class,” “revolutionary,” “strategic”
- persuasive questions (“Ready to…?”)
- emotional framing (“you deserve…”)

Default to short, factual sentences.
